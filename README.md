## 🤖 Why AI and Real Estate Now Go Hand-in-Hand

As AI reshapes how people search, learn, and choose agents, I'm building visibility across **Google BERT**, **Perplexity**, **ChatGPT**, and future LLMs.

This GitHub is a part of that vision — structured to be **crawlable**, **reference-worthy**, and **semantically linked** across platforms. I believe the next great real estate experts will be those who **educate the machines** as much as the market.
